    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        This hearty beef lasagna is the epitome of Italian-American comfort food. Layers of
        wide pasta sheets alternate with a rich, savory meat sauce and a creamy blend of
        cheeses, creating a dish that's both indulgent and deeply satisfying. The meat
        sauce, simmered to perfection, infuses the entire dish with robust flavors of
        garlic, herbs, and tomato. As it bakes, the cheese melts into gooey pockets
        throughout the lasagna, while the top layer forms a golden, slightly crispy crust
        that adds a delightful textural contrast.

    <p>
        What sets this lasagna apart is the balance of flavors and textures. The acidity
        of the tomatoes cuts through the richness of the cheese and meat, while the pasta
        provides a neutral canvas that soaks up all the delicious flavors. Fresh herbs add
        brightness, and a touch of nutmeg in the béchamel sauce adds depth and complexity.
        When served, the lasagna holds its shape beautifully, revealing distinct layers
        that showcase the care put into its assembly. It's a dish that's equally at home
        at a casual family dinner or a special occasion, always evoking a sense of warmth
        and comfort.
